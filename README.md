# Pokemon Memory - my first JavaScript project! (early 2019)

I started this project when I enrolled in my first programming course in 2017. In 2018, my programming journey was on pause while I worked at an adventure travel company. Then, in early 2019 I quit my job and dove head-first into programming full-time. After brushing up on my JavaScript skills, I returned to this project to finish what I started about 18 months prior. 

This simple game of memory is the first completed project I ever made, using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I completed it in early 2019.

This memory game is frontend only--it doesn't connect to a database in any way. It was a fun challenge for me at the time, and I enjoy keeping this project around as a reminder of my programming journey. 

I haven't touched the code since I finished it in early 2019--and I'm scared to even look at it! Haha
